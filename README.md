# Welcome! 

This is essentially a living project of experimentation with different front-end web development tools as I come across them or care to practice with. 

I started tinkering around with `HTML` back when I was in middle school - and this was around 2001. My online friends and I would make Sonic the Hedgehog sprite comics, recolor them to be our own unique characters, and then we branched out to creating a whole SonicRPG and roped other random internet dudes into it. Man that was fun - I'd like to say, for a pre-teen back in the early 2000's, I was picking up quite a bit.

Fast forward about 20 years after I gave up that "hobby" and now I find myself feeling eternally behind as the space has evolved (and continues to do so, of course) while trying to get back into it for an eventual profession. Ugh. Just imagine if I actually stuck with it all these years. 

### Goals

I want to eventually use this as a central portfolio for any kind of front/back end development projects I think would be noteworthy to display, publicly.
